        During last year’s Abundance Summit, Emad Mostaque, CEO of Stability
        AI, made the statement that we would have “no more humans coding in 5
        years.” Should we embrace this as inevitable and tell our kids they no
        longer need to learn to code? There’s strong evidence that AI has
        already surpassed the ability of human coders, let’s look at three
        datapoints: 1. In early 2023, OpenAI’s ChatGPT passed Google’s exam
        for high-level software developers. 2. Later in 2023, GitHub reported
        that 46% of code across all programming languages is built using
        Copilot, the company’s AI-powered developer tool. 3. Finally,
        DeepMind’s AlphaCode in its debut outperformed human programmers. When
        pitted against over 5,000 human participants, the AI beat 45% of
        expert programmers. Given that all these developments took place
        within the first year of ChatGPT’s release, what is likely to happen
        over the next two or three years as the tech advances even further?
        Will AI eliminate the need for human programmers altogether later this
        decade? Or, perhaps, rather than eliminate coders, will generative AI
        allow any and all of us to become coders? In today’s blog, I want to
        paint a more hopeful and compelling picture of the future — one that
        flips our perspective from scarcity to abundance. A future in which
        more people than ever will be able to leverage the power of coding to
        solve important problems and uplift humanity. Let’s dive in… NOTE: At
        next month’s 2024 Abundance Summit, we’ll have Nat Friedman (Former
        CEO, GitHub); Mustafa Suleyman (Co-Founder, DeepMind; CEO, Inflection
        AI); Emad Mustaque (CEO, Stability AI); Eric Schmidt (Former CEO &
        Chairman, Google); Ray Kurzweil (Google) and many more AI leaders
        discussing this topic of “AI and coding” and its ability to turn us
        all into coders in the near future.
