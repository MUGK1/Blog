            <p>
                During last year’s Abundance Summit, Emad Mostaque, CEO of Stability AI, made the statement that we
                would
                have “no more
                humans coding in 5 years.”
                Should we embrace this as inevitable and tell our kids they no longer need to learn to code?
                There’s strong evidence that AI has already surpassed the ability of human coders, let’s look at three
                datapoints:
                1. In early 2023, OpenAI’s ChatGPT passed Google’s exam for high-level software developers.
                2. Later in 2023, GitHub reported that 46% of code across all programming languages is built using
                Copilot,
                the
                company’s AI-powered developer tool.
                3. Finally, DeepMind’s AlphaCode in its debut outperformed human programmers. When pitted against over
                5,000
                human
                participants, the AI beat 45% of expert programmers.
                Given that all these developments took place within the first year of ChatGPT’s release, what is likely
                to
                happen over
                the next two or three years as the tech advances even further?
                Will AI eliminate the need for human programmers altogether later this decade?
                Or, perhaps, rather than eliminate coders, will generative AI allow any and all of us to become coders?
                In today’s blog, I want to paint a more hopeful and compelling picture of the future — one that flips
                our
                perspective
                from scarcity to abundance. A future in which more people than ever will be able to leverage the power
                of
                coding to
                solve important problems and uplift humanity.
                Let’s dive in…
                NOTE: At next month’s 2024 Abundance Summit, we’ll have Nat Friedman (Former CEO, GitHub); Mustafa
                Suleyman
                (Co-Founder,
                DeepMind; CEO, Inflection AI); Emad Mustaque (CEO, Stability AI); Eric Schmidt (Former CEO & Chairman,
                Google); Ray
                Kurzweil (Google) and many more AI leaders discussing this topic of “AI and coding” and its ability to
                turn
                us all into
                coders in the near future.
